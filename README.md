# Question and Answer Website - README

## Introduction:
This project revolves around the creation of a website designed for asking and answering questions- like a forum. It provides a platform where users can pose queries, respond to others' questions, and receive answers. The website covers various topics such as mathematics, physics, English, and computer science. Its primary audience includes individuals seeking answers, those who enjoy asking questions, and those interested in contributing answers. The ultimate aim of the site is to establish an active forum facilitating knowledge exchange and problem-solving.

## Description:
Upon accessing the homepage, users encounter four primary links:

1. **About Us**: Provides information about the website and its creators.
2. **Privacy Policy**: Details the privacy guidelines and policies governing user data.
3. **Get Started**: Directs new users to the registration screen.
4. **Login**: Allows existing users to log into their accounts.

After login, users gain access to the main menu, comprising four additional pages:

1. **My Profile**: Displays the logged-in user's list of questions along with the number of responses received. Filtering options by question topic are available, with appropriate messages displayed if no content is present.
2. **Questions**: Presents questions from other users on the site, excluding the logged-in user. Users can provide answers to these questions, with filtering options based on topic.
3. **Logout**: Logs out the current user and redirects them to the login page. Certain links remain accessible but restricted.
4. **Admin Page**: Exclusive to administrators, this page includes two sub-pages:
    - **Users List**: Displays all users' information including name, surname, username, and email address.
    - **User Management**: Allows editing user information, except for password and username. Administrators can designate other users as administrators and have the option to delete user accounts. However, administrators cannot delete their own accounts.

## Usage:
1. **Non-Registered Users**: Can access "About Us," "Privacy Policy," "Login," and "Register" pages.
2. **Logged-in Users**: Access to all pages except "Users Edit" and "User Info," exclusive to administrators.
3. **Administrators**: Have unrestricted access to all pages.
